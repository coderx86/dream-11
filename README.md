BPL-DREAM 11 is a cricket bidding site where users can assemble their ultimate Dream 11 team by selecting players based on stats, roles, and prices. The interface features player cards with details like country, role, batting and bowling type, and bidding price. Users can add players to their team and manage selections, with an option to claim free credits. The site includes navigation links, a newsletter subscription section, and footer links for additional resources.

## Technologies Used:

-   **React**: For building the user interface components and managing application state.
-   **React-Toastify**: For displaying toast notifications to improve user experience.
-   **JSON**: For storing player data.

## 3 Key Features in this Project:

-   **Player Selection and Management**: Users can select players to build their team, with options to add or remove players. Users can toggle between ‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù and ‚ÄúSelected‚Äù player lists, allowing easy navigation and management of chosen players.
-   **Coin Management System**: Users have an initial coin balance that increases with a button click, allowing them to buy players based on their available coins.
-   **Validation and Notification System**: The app uses React-Toastify for user alerts, validating conditions like coin balance, duplicate selections, and a maximum limit of six selected players.
